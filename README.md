## LavaLust Version 3

    This version will hold the mass updates of the kernel files and built-in libraries of LavaLust Framework. It will also attempt to fix all issues from the its version 2 with PHP 8.1+

## Changelog

1. Remove xss_clean() using Escaper class. If you want to use it, install htmlpurifier library then
   create a function "xss_clean" inside a helper.
2. You can now use different instances of database connections. Changes also affect
   the database.php file inside the config folder. (Every instances depends on the key of database array
   variable.)
   $this->call->database();
   _ This will enable $this->db variable to handle queries.
   $this->call->database('other*connection');
   * This will open new connection based on the parameter "other_connection". You will
   need to create new index in database array named "other_connection" inside database.php
   file. It will enable $this->other_connection to handle queries.
3. Inside view fie, if you pass $data variable from controller, you can easily use the array key of
   it inside the view.
   Example: Controller

```php
        function index() {
            $this->call->model('user_model');
            $data['users] = $this->user_model->get_all_users();
            $this->call->view('user_view_file', $data);
        }
```

        Inside view file you can extract values of $data['users] by just using its key "users"
        Example: View

```php
            foreach($users as $user) {
                echo $user['some_index'];
            }
```

        Moreover, you can also pass a plain string to view file.
        Example: Controller

```php function index() {
                $this->call->model('user_model');
                $data = "This is a string.";
                $this->call->view('user_view_file', $data);
            }
```

4. In models, you dont't need to add exec() method in insert(), update() and delete() because Lavalust
        automatically added it for you.
    Example: model
        ```php
            $this->db->insert($bind);
        ```
5. You can now use put models inside sub directories.
    Example: model/sub_dir/Sample_model.php
        ```php
            $thi->call->model('sub_dir/sample');
            $this->sample->method();
        ```

## What is LavaLust?

    LavaLust is a lightweight Web Framework - (using MVC pattern) - for people who are developing web sites using PHP. It helps
    you write code easily using Object-Oriented Approach. It also provides set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as
    a helper functions to minimize the amount of time coding.

    LavaLust is somehow similar to CodeIgniter 3 structure and call to commonly used functions but way different when it comes to
    class construction. This is very simple and ultimately light. The main purpose of this is to teach the basics of OOP and how
    it will work with MVC. You will see in the documentation the similarities I am pertaining to.
