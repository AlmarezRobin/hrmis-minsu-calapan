## LavaLust Version 2.0.5

    This is the continuous development using PHP 7.2 to 7.4+. This version is more stable compare to v2.1 which was only released for PHP 8.1 compatibility. V2.0+ will be the official release of Lavalust until further notice.

### Overview of Changes in Version 2

#### Note: you can still use the framework version 2 the way you use the version 1 before

    -> $this->load is now $this->call
    -> super object get_instance is now lava_instance()
    ->folder structures but you can still change it to your preferred names and path
    	* application is now app
    	* system is now scheme
    	* assets is now public
    	* core is now kernel
    	* benchmark class is now performance. see the changelog.txt for more details
    	* Constants and mimes file inside config folder was also deleted. We are making the framework as simple and as
    	light as possible
    ->cache is now inside runtime folder

### Update Version 1 to Version 2

    1. Backup your files..
    2. Replace all files and directories in your system/ directory with the files and directories from scheme/ folder of version 2.
    3. If you are using the constants and mimes that were deleted in version 2, please take note of those things and update your app manually.

## What is LavaLust?

    LavaLust is an lightweight Web Framework - (using MVC pattern) - for people who are developing web sites using PHP. It helps
    you write code easily using Object-Oriented Approach. It also provides set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as
    a helper functions to minimize the amount of time coding.

    LavaLust is somehow similar to CodeIgniter 3 structure and call to commonly used functions but way different when it comes to
    class construction. This is very simple and ultimately light. The main purpose of this is to teach the basics of OOP and how
    it will work with MVC. You will see in the documentation the similarities I am pertaining to.
