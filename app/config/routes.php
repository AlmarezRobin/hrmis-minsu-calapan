| URI ROUTING
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
| This file lets you re-map URI requests to specific controller functions.
|
| Typically there is a one-to-one relationship between a URL string
| and its corresponding controller class/method. The segments in a
| URL normally follow this pattern:
|
|	example.com/class/method/id/
|
| In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship
| so that a different class/function is called than the one
| corresponding to the URL.
|
| $route['translate_uri_dashes'] = TRUE will enable to use dash(-) instead 
| of underscore(_) in URI
|
| $route['404_override'] is use if you want to add custom 404 error page.
| 
|	example: $route['404_override'] = 'default/404'
|
|	if you have 'default folder' and '404.php file' inside error folder in view
*/
$route['404_override']       	= '';
$route['translate_uri_dashes'] 	= FALSE;
